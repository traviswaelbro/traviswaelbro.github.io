      <description>What is pre-commit?  pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
 Basically, pre-commit is a Python package that provides a maintainable way to manage your git hooks. Git hooks allow you to run some code (or commands) on certain git events, such as before and after commits, before and after pushes, and more. Use it to automate validation, linting, and more to keep your codebase in check before things even hit the git server.</description>

      <description>Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why you&amp;rsquo;re here, but if you want to read about things I find interesting, then stick around!
I&amp;rsquo;m an Application Engineer at Blue Stingray, a software company in St. Louis, MO. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Odoo projects for about 3 years at this point, which is written in Python and XML. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Sublime Text most of my career, but I switched to Neovim full time earlier this year and I&amp;rsquo;m not looking back.</description>
